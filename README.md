# MachineLearning


This is a simple exercice on Python implementation of different Machine Learning algorithms: SVM, DecisionTree, 
which are currenty available. In March 2018, I will implement also unsupervised learning and deep learning.

Added a toy class solving simple maze problems with RL algorithms

Starting looking back and testing basic functions of the module I developped. 
- Neural network has worked on MNIST dataset, in spite of long training time, as the back propagation is not optimized and traverse all sample points.

The Neural Network and EM were added in March/April 2018. Now it's time to practice something more interesting: reinforcement learning and NLP
